                Safety: Makerspaces often contain sensitive electronic components, tools, and machines. Food and drinks can cause damage if spilled on the equipment.
                Cleanliness: A clean working environment is important to maintain the functionality and lifespan of the equipment.Food remnants can attract pests or cause bacterial growth.
                Focus and professionalism: Makerspace is primarily a work and learning environment. Avoiding food and drinks helps maintain a professional environment and keeps the focus on project work. 
                Allergy considerations: Some people may have severe food allergies. By keeping food out of the area, the risk of allergic reactions is reduced.
                Protection of projects: Ongoing projects of others can be damaged by spills or food residues. It is common practice to have dedicated areas outside the actual workspace for eating and drinking.`
